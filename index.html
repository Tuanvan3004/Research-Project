        <p>
          League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
          multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
          Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
          Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
          the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
          free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
          customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player
          combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each
          of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with
          unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match,
          champions become more powerful by collecting experience points,
          earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In
          League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to
          the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located
          within.

            History of League of Legends
          </h1>
          <p>
            After the release, League of Legends quickly became one of the most
            popular games in the world. It was played in Asia, Europe, NA, SA -
            everywhere. Competitions were held and leagues started to form -
            enabling professionals to solely focus on being the best of the best.
            According to Riot Games, League of Legends had 15 million players by
            2011, a little bit more than a year after its release. Ten new games    
            were started every second. Just think about it. 10 new games EVERY 1
            second?! That is wild. It also shows you the incredible range and
            potential of the world of gaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first ever international tournament was held at DreamHack, known
            as Season 1 World Championship, in 2011. It would be a continuously
            held tournament which, to this day, serves as the most premier League
            of Legends competition in the world. Last year it recorded a total
            viewership of 100 million people, averaging 21,8 million viewers a
            minute and a peak concurrent viewership of 44 million. Yeah, that's 44
            million people watching a game at the same exact time. With the
            exception of the World Championship, or Worlds, League of Legends has
            several other major international tournaments annually: the Mid-Season
            Invitational and the All-Stars, to name a few. There's also several
            regional competitions, tournaments and leagues: the biggest and most
            well-known being LEC, LCS, LCK and LPL - the premier leagues of
            Europe, North America, South Korea and China. The meta usually differs
            region to region, so when international competitions takes place,
            we're often spoiled with amazing mash-ups of gameplay.

          <p>
            Playing games can be a great way to reduce stress and take your mind
            off things, especially if you've had a particularly long day and
            want a break. However, instead of giving yourself a mental boost, a
            study has shown that action video games could increase the risk of
            mental health issues.
